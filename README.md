First Repository

Hello world, I'm just starting to take programming seriously so I thought I should learn to use github.

I started taking the edX MIT 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science course using Python last week. I'm using Anaconda and Python as my IDE and am enjoying it so far.

One additional perk is I suckered my wife into taking the course with me. We're both considering career changes into the programming world and I feel this is the perfect initial step in the right direction. I imagine she will be creating a github account in the near future as well.
